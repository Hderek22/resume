"_Focus on the success of your Teammates and amazing things will happen for you!_"

One thing you should know about me is...I don't dabble. It is simply not in my nature. If I set out to accomplish a goal, I'm all in, end of story.

I started bussing tables as a teenager and liked the business...at age 30 I owned 3 restaurants.

I pursued big box retail after selling my business of 14 years...within 3 years I was managing 150M annualy.

I took up running to get healthy and ended up running the NYC marathon twice.

Its safe to say I'm certainly not one to dabble.
